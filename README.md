# DeFi Wallet Scoring Project

## Objective

This notebook builds a full pipeline to evaluate wallet behavior in DeFi. It reads raw transaction data, generates wallet-level features like activity span, protocol usage, and financial signals, then applies a scoring logic to assign a numeric score to each wallet. These scores help segment users by engagement, risk, or strategy.

The repo includes:
- One Python notebook with all processing and scoring logic.
- `README.md` for quick overview.
- `analysis.md` with behavior insights based on scores.

## Input Format

Input is a JSON file (`user-wallet-transactions.json`) where each record is one transaction with fields like:

- `_id`: Unique transaction ID.
- `userWallet`: User's wallet address.
- `network`: Chain name (e.g., `"polygon"`).
- `protocol`: DeFi protocol (e.g., `"aave_v2"`, `"uniswap_v3"`).
- `txHash`: Transaction hash.
- `timestamp`: Unix time of transaction.
- `action`: Type of interaction (`"deposit"`, `"borrow"`, `"repay"`, `"swap"` etc.).
- `actionData`: Nested object with:
  - `amount`: Volume of asset.
  - `assetSymbol`: Token symbol (e.g., `"ETH"`).
  - `assetPriceUSD`: USD value at time of action.
  - Optional: `poolId`, `userId`.
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Metadata timestamps.

Schema is general-purpose and works across protocols.

## Method: Rule-Based Scoring

This system uses a transparent rule-based model to assign scores to wallets based on observable DeFi activity. It emphasizes interpretabilityâ€”each behavioral signal (e.g., deposit size, protocol diversity, repayment activity) maps directly to scoring logic. Unlike opaque machine learning models, this structure is traceable and modular, ideal for early-stage analytics or product segmentation.
