# Wallet Scoring Analysis

This document analyzes wallet scores generated by the DeFi Wallet Scoring System. It breaks down score distribution and highlights common behaviors across low- and high-scoring wallets.

## Score Distribution

Wallet scores range from [Min Score] to [Max Score], assigned via a rule-based model that evaluates raw DeFi transaction behavior. The distribution reflects user engagement and risk patterns.

### Score Distribution Graph

(*Graph is generated inside the notebook via `score_distribution.png` or equivalent. In a Markdown-only version, it would be embedded here.*)

Key observations from the plot:

- Most wallets cluster in the `[100–300]` range, indicating minimal DeFi activity or usage restricted to a single protocol or asset type.
- Scores above `[500]` are less common, suggesting fewer wallets show sustained or diversified behavior.
- Lowest-scoring wallets (`0–99`) likely represent inactive, one-time, or non-participatory users.
- Very few wallets reach the `800+` bracket, indicating sustained multi-protocol usage, consistent borrowing/repayment, and large transaction volumes are rare.

## Behavior: Low Score Wallets (e.g., 0–200)

Typical traits observed in wallets scoring between 0 and 200:

- **Minimal Transactions:** Total interactions usually ≤5.
- **Low USD Volume:** Combined asset value typically <$1,000 across all transactions.
- **Single Protocol Use:** Often only one DeFi platform used.
- **No Full Cycles:** Few or no repays after borrows; may only deposit or swap.
- **Inactive:** Large gap since last transaction; many wallets dormant after initial usage.

These users exhibit shallow DeFi exposure—either new, passive, or test accounts with limited participation.

## Behavior: High Score Wallets (e.g., 800–1000+)

Wallets scoring in the 800+ range display advanced and frequent DeFi behavior:

- **High Volume & Frequency:** Often >100 transactions; large cumulative USD value.
- **Sustained Usage:** Wide `days_active_span`, frequent recent activity.
- **Protocol Diversity:** Involvement in ≥5 protocols, covering lending, swapping, pooling.
- **Full Financial Cycles:** Borrowing and consistent repayments with near 1:1 ratios.
- **Asset Spread:** Interaction with 5+ unique tokens, showing portfolio diversity.

These wallets likely belong to sophisticated users, automated systems, or DeFi-native participants engaging in liquidity provision, arbitrage, or cross-protocol strategies.
